"""A tuple is a sequence of values much like a list. 
The values stored in a tuple can be any type, and they are indexed by integers. 
The important difference is that tuples are immutable. 
Tuples are also comparable and hashable so we can sort lists of them and use tuples as key values in Python dictionaries"""
